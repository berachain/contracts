# Fast Forward Workflow
# This workflow automatically fast-forwards pull requests with the 'fast-forward' label
# when they receive an approved review. It ensures proper branch hierarchy:
# - PRs targeting 'bepolia' must come from 'devel' branch
# - PRs targeting 'main' must come from 'bepolia' branch
# The workflow uses sequoia-pgp/fast-forward action to merge changes automatically.
