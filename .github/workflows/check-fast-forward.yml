# Fast Forward Check Workflow
# This workflow validates pull requests with the 'fast-forward' label to ensure they follow
# the correct branch hierarchy before allowing fast-forward merging:
# - PRs targeting 'bepolia' must come from 'devel' branch
# - PRs targeting 'main' must come from 'bepolia' branch
# The workflow runs on PR events and validates branch structure without merging.
